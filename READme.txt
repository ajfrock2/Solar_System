Solar System Simulation
-Austin Frock


OVERVIEW
This is an interactive Solar System simulation built with JavaScript, HTML, and WebGL. This model depicts the orbits and rotations of the sun, moon, and all 8 planets within our solar system, with textured surfaces and dynamic lighting. 

The project started as a final assignment for my graphics class, where the goal was to create a basic solar system model. However, my professor motivated us to expand on the project and build something we’d feel proud to showcase. I ended up spending a lot of time implementing some of the extra credit suggestions and even added a bunch of my own creative twists, ultimately designing a project I’m pleased to show off.


HOW TO RUN
1.Clone or Download the repository to your local machine.
2.Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3.Run the project using the Live Server extension or any local server setup.
